              Buying a new home can be a nerve-wracking process in this market –
              especially if you’re a first-time homebuyer. Unfortunately, this
              is also one of the most expensive purchases you’re likely to make.
              As a result, it’s important to have as much information as
              possible at your fingertips, so that you are well equipped to make
              an informed decision. From checking your credit ratings to
              speaking with housing financiers about appropriate mortgage rates,
              young homebuyers need to go into this process with their eyes wide
              open.

              Saving money for a mortgage deposit can be tricky. Therefore, a
              good option for buying a property may be a 95% mortgage which
              allows for a deposit as low as 5%. Exclusions & eligibility
              criteria apply.
